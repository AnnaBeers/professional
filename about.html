<div class="bioblock">Hi!<br /><br />
    I'm Anna Beers. I am a Visting Postdoctoral Fellow for <a herf="https://www.bwstiftung.de/de/programm/sonderprogramm-fuer-internationale-wissenschaftsfreiheit">International Academic Freedom</a> at the University of Tuebingen, where I am doing comparative reseach on how far-right media interacts with technological cultures, including influencer/creator culture and emerging algorithmic technologies frequently referred to as "AI."" I received my PhD from the University of Washington's <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Design and Engineering</a> program (HCDE). From 2024-2025, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's <a href="https://citap.unc.edu/">Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life</a>.
<br /><br />

I research social media influencers, science communication, and right-wing extremism on social media using network science, machine learning, and mixed methods. More specifically, I focus on understanding how different social media influencers in United States digital politics work together and against each other to produce the "news" we see online, with a particular emphasis on where this process breaks down. I have published first-author work in venues such as <em>Science Advances</em>, <em>Information, Communication, and Society</em>, <em>ICWSM</em>, <em>The Journal of Online Trust and Safety</em>, <em>AoIR</em>, and others.
<br /><br />

Before my PhD, I worked at the <a href="https://www.martinos.org/lab/qtim">Quantitative Translational Imaging Lab</a> (QTIM) at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. My work at the QTIM focused on machine learning as applied to medical imaging scans, as well as software development for the imaging program <a href="https://www.slicer.org/">3D Slicer</a> and the Python package <a href="https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/DeepNeuro">DeepNeuro</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Brown University in the Environmental Studies department researching historical records of climate change in the North Atlantic ocean. In between, I have worked for non-profit organizations in research and fundraising capacities.<br /><br />
